# Text-Classification-Using-Wordlist
An approach for text classification using Word List

It is widely acknowledged that scientific paper writing is a complex task since it involves the complexities of the writing process as well as those specific to aca demic genre. Many readers are interested in specific type of scientific information,
e.g background of study, methods used in study or results obtained.  

If observed closely abstracts in scientific papers tend to be very similar in terms of the information structure. For example - abstracts start with some background information before defining the objective of a study and conclusions are preceded by the description of results obtained. So an abstract can be considered as self-contained yet short and powerful piece of statements that describes a larger work. Hence classification of abstracts into different categories can ease of reading a scientific abstract further and also help in information extraction and summarizing.

This work just gives an simple example with wordlist. You can have your own word list for text classification.
